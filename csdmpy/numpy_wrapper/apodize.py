"""
A wrapper to the Numpy functions used to apodize the components along a given
dimension. If :math:`x` is  the coordinates along the dimension, the apodization
function follows,

.. math::
        y = function(a x),

where :math:`a` is the argument of the function. The dimensionality of :math:`a`
must be reciprocal of that of :math:`x`.

The list of supported functions are:
    - sin
    - cos
    - ...
