Labeled Dataset

# The CSD model also supports labeled dimensions. In the following example, we
# present a mixed `linear` and `labeled` two-dimensional dataset representing
# the population of the country as a function of time. The dataset is obtained from
# `The World Bank <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?view=chart>`_.
#
# Import the `csdmpy` model and load the dataset.
import csdmpy as cp

filename = "https://www.ssnmr.org/sites/default/files/CSDM/labeled/population.csdf"
labeled_data = cp.load(filename)

# %%
# The tuple of dimension and dependent variable objects from ``labeled_data`` instance
# are
x = labeled_data.dimensions
y = labeled_data.dependent_variables

# %%
# Since one of the dimensions is a `labeled` dimension, let's make use of the
# :attr:`~csdmpy.Dimension.type` attribute of the dimension instances
# to find out which dimension is `labeled`.
print(x[0].type)

# %%
print(x[1].type)

# Here, the second dimension is the `labeled` dimension with [#f1]_
print(x[1].count)

# %%
# labels, where the first five labels are
print(x[1].labels[:5])

# %%
# .. note::
#     For labeled dimensions, the :attr:`~csdmpy.Dimension.coordinates`
#     attribute is an alias of the :attr:`~csdmpy.Dimension.labels`
#     attribute.
print(x[1].coordinates[:5])

# %%
# The coordinates along the first dimension, viewed up to the first ten
# points, are

# **Plotting the dataset**
#
# You may plot this dataset however you like. Here, we use a bar graph to
# represent the population of countries in the year 2017. The data
# corresponding to this year is a cross-section of the dependent variable
# at index 57 along the ``x[0]`` dimension.
print(x[0].coordinates[57])

# %%
# To keep the plot simple, we only plot the first 20 country labels along
# the ``x[1]`` dimension.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x_data = x[1].coordinates[:20]
x_pos = np.arange(20)
y_data = y[0].components[0][:20, 57]

plt.bar(x_data, y_data, align="center", alpha=0.5)
plt.xticks(x_pos, x_data, rotation=90)
plt.ylabel(y[0].axis_label[0])
plt.yscale("log")
plt.title(y[0].name)

# .. rubric:: Footnotes
#
# .. [#f1] In the CSD model, the attribute count is only valid for the
#          :ref:`linearDimension_uml`. In `csdmpy`, however, the
#          :attr:`~csdmpy.Dimension.count` attribute is valid for all
#          dimension objects and returns an integer with the number of grid
#          points along the dimension.
