Global Mean Sea Level rise dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"""
# %%
# The following dataset is the Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise from the late
# 19th to the Early 21st Century [#f0]_. The
# `original dataset <http://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_data_cmar.html>`_ was
# downloaded as a CSV file and subsequently converted to the CSD model format.
#
# Let's import this file.
import csdmpy as cp

filename = "https://www.ssnmr.org/sites/default/files/CSDM/gmsl/GMSL.csdf"
sea_level = cp.load(filename)

# %%
# The variable `filename` is a string with the address to the `.csdf` file.
# The :meth:`~csdmpy.load` method of the `csdmpy` module reads the
# file and returns an instance of the :ref:`csdm_api` class, in
# this case, as a variable ``sea_level``. For a quick preview of the data
# structure, use the :attr:`~csdmpy.CSDM.data_structure` attribute of this
# instance.

print(sea_level.data_structure)

# %%
# .. warning::
#     The serialized string from the :attr:`~csdmpy.CSDM.data_structure`
#     attribute is not the same as the JSON serialization on the file.
#     This attribute is only intended for a quick preview of the data
#     structure and avoids displaying large datasets. Do not use
#     the value of this attribute to save the data to the file. Instead, use the
#     :meth:`~csdmpy.CSDM.save` method of the :ref:`CSDM <csdm_api>`
#     class.

# %%
# The tuple of the dimensions and dependent variables, from this example, are

x = sea_level.dimensions
y = sea_level.dependent_variables

# %%
# respectively. The coordinates along the dimension and the
# component of the dependent variable are
print(x[0].coordinates)

# %%
# and
print(y[0].components[0])

# %%
# respectively.

# %%
# **Plotting the data**
#
# .. note::
#     The following code is only for illustrative purposes. The users may use
#     any plotting library to visualize their datasets.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(5, 3.5))
ax = plt.subplot(projection="csdm")

# csdmpy is compatible with matplotlib function. Use the csdm object as the argument
# of the matplotlib function.
ax.plot(sea_level)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# %%
#   The following is a quick description of the above code. Within the code, we
#   make use of the csdm instance's attributes in addition to the matplotlib
#   functions. The first line is an import call for the matplotlib functions.
#   The following line generates a plot of the coordinates along the
#   dimension verse the component of the dependent variable.
#   The next line sets the x-range. For labeling the axes,
#   use the :attr:`~csdmpy.Dimension.axis_label` attribute
#   of both dimension and dependent variable instances. For the figure title,
#   use the :attr:`~csdmpy.DependentVariable.name` attribute
#   of the dependent variable instance. The next statement adds the grid lines.
#   For additional information, refer to `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_
#   documentation.
