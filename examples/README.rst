In this section, we present illustrative examples for importing files
serialized with the CSD model, using the `csdmpy` package.
Because the CSD model allows multi-dimensional datasets with multiple dependent
variables, we use a shorthand notation of :math:`d\mathrm{D}\{p\}` to
indicate that a dataset has a :math:`p`-component dependent variable defined
on a :math:`d`-dimensional coordinate grid.
In the case of `correlated datasets`, the number of components in each
dependent variable is given as a list within the curly braces, `i.e.`,
:math:`d\mathrm{D}\{p_0, p_1, p_2, ...\}`.
