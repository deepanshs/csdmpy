v0.3.1
------

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Bugfix regarding the phase multiplier for the ``CSDM.fft()`` methods where an
  incorrect phase was multiplied to the signal vector.

v0.3.0
------

What's new!
'''''''''''

- Support for ``matplotlib.pyplot`` functions from ``CSDM`` objects.
    - ``plot``,
    - ``scatter``,
    - ``imshow``,
    - ``contour``, and
    - ``contourf``

------

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fixed bug where the metadata from the ``csdm.application`` key was not serialized
  to the file when using ``csdm.save()`` method.
- Fixed a bug where the transpose of a CSDM object failed to retain the quantity_type
  information after the transpose.

Other changes
'''''''''''''

- Add a new diffusion tensor MRI dataset to the example gallery.
- Added ``dict()`` as an alias to the ``to_dict()`` method for all objects.
- Added an alias of the ``cp.plot()`` function to the CSDM object as the
  ``plot()`` method.

      in-place.
    - ``split()`` = Split the dependent-variables into individual csdm objects.

- Support for Numpy dimension reduction functions
    - ``sum()``: Sum along a given dimension.
    - ``prod()``: Product along a given dimension.

- Support for Numpy ufunc functions:
    - ``sin``, ``cos``, ``tan``, ``arcsin``, ``arccos``, ``arctan``, ``sinh``, ``cosh``,
      ``tanh``, ``arcsinh``, ``arccosh``, ``arctanh``, ``exp``, ``exp2``, ``log``,

      ``absolute``, ``fabs``, ``rint``, ``sign``, ``conj``, ``conjugate``, ``sqrt``,
      ``cbrt``, ``reciprocal``

- Added apodization functions.
    - ``sin``, ``cos``, ``tan``, ``arcsin``, ``arccos``, ``arctan``, ``exp``

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fixed a bug in ``cp.plot()`` method.

v0.1.5
------

- Added method to convert the frequency dimension to nmr dimensionless frequency ratio
  with syntax, ``dimension.to('ppm', 'nmr_frequency_ratio')``, where `dimension` is a
  LinearDimension object.
- The ``csdmpy.plot()`` method also displays the dimension index on the axis label.

v0.1.4
------

- Added ``to_dict()`` method to the CSDM, Dimension, and DependentVariable objects.

v0.1.3
------

- Fixed warning message when physical quantity name is not found in the astropy units
  package.
- Added dumps and loads function to dump and load the data model as json serialized
  string, respectively without serializing it to a file.

v0.0.11 to v0.1.2
-----------------

- Add a required `unsigned_interger_type` for SparseSampling dimension.
- Fixed minor bugs.
- Added a tags attribute to the CSDmodel object.
- Changed 'sampling_interval' key to 'count'.
- Changed 'quantity' key to 'quantity_name'.
- Changed 'index_zero_value' key to 'coordinates_offset'.
- Changed 'fft_output_order' key to 'complex_fft'.
- Renamed IndependentVariable class to Dimension.
- Renamed LinearlySpacedDimension class to LinearDimension.
- Renamed ArbitrarilySpacedDimension class to MonotonicDimension.
