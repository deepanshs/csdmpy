The `csdmpy` package is the Python support for the core scientific
dataset (CSD) model file exchange-format.
The package is based on the core scientific dataset (CSD) model which is
designed as a building block in the development of a more sophisticated
portable scientific dataset file standard.
The CSD model is capable of handling a wide variety of
scientific datasets both within and across disciplinary fields.

The main objective of this python package is to facilitate an easy import and
export of the CSD model serialized files for Python users. The
package utilizes Numpy library and, therefore, offers the end users versatility
to process or visualize the imported datasets with any third party package(s)
compatible with Numpy.
