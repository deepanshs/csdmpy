==================================
Welcome to csdfpy's documentation!
==================================

The `csdfpy` module is the Python support for the core scientific
dataset (CSD) model file-format exchange.
This module is based on the core scientific dataset (CSD) model which is
designed as a building block in the development of a more sophisticated
portable scientific dataset file standard.
The CSD model is capable of handling a wide variety of
scientific datasets both within and across disciplinary fields, and therefore
is a viable data-exchange model.

The main objective of this python module is to facilitate an easy import and
export of the CSD model serialized files for Python users. Moreover, the
module utilizes Python libraries such as Numpy and Scipy and
therefore allowing the end users to process or visualize the imported datasets
with any third party package(s) compatible with Numpy and Scipy.
