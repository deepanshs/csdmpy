Serializing CSDM object to file
-------------------------------

An instance of a :ref:`csdm_api` object is serialized as a csdf/csdfe
JSON-format file with the :meth:`~csdmpy.CSDM.save` method.
When serializing the dependent-variable from the CSDM object to the data-file,
the `csdmpy` module uses the value of the dependent variable's
:attr:`~csdmpy.DependentVariable.encoding` attribute to
determine the encoding type of the serialized data. There are three encoding
types for the dependent variables:

- ``none``
- ``base64``
- ``raw``

.. note:: By default, all instances of
    :attr:`~csdmpy.DependentVariable` from a
    :attr:`~csdmpy.CSDM` object are serialized as
    base64 strings.

For the following examples, consider ``data`` as an instance of the
:attr:`~csdmpy.CSDM` class.

To serialize a dependent variable with a given encoding type, set the value
of it's encoding attribute to the respective encoding. For example,

**As ``none`` encoding**

.. code::

    >>> data.dependent_variables[0].encoding = "none"
    >>> data.save('my_file.csdf')

The above code will serialize the dependent variable at index zero to a JSON
file, `my_file.csdf`, where each component of the dependent variable is
serialized as an array of JSON number.

**As ``base64`` encoding**

    >>> data.dependent_variables[0].encoding = "base64"
    >>> data.save('my_file.csdf')

The above code will serialize the dependent variable at index zero to a JSON
file, `my_file.csdf`, where each component of the dependent variable is
serialized as a base64 string.

**As ``raw`` encoding**

    >>> data.dependent_variables[0].encoding = "raw"
    >>> data.save('my_file.csdfe')

The above code will serialize the metadata from the dependent variable at index
zero to a
JSON file, `my_file.csdfe`, which includes a link to an external file where the
components of the respective dependent variable are serialized as a binary
array. The binary file is named, `my_file_0.dat`, where `my_file` is the
filename from the argument of the save method, and `0` is the index number of
the dependent variable from the CSDM object.

**Multiple encoding types**

In the case of multiple dependent-variables, you may choose to serialize
each dependent variables with a different encoding, for example,

.. code::

    >>> my_data.dependent_variables[0].encoding = "raw"
    >>> my_data.dependent_variables[1].encoding = "base64"
    >>> my_data.dependent_variables[2].encoding = "none"
    >>> my_data.dependent_variables[3].encoding = "base64"
    >>> my_data.save('my_file.csdfe')

In the above example, ``my_data`` is a CSDM object containing four
:attr:`~csdmpy.DependentVariable` objects. Here, we
serialize the dependent variable at index two with ``none``,
the dependent variables at index one and three with ``bae64``,
and the dependent variables at index zero with ``raw`` encoding, respectively.

.. note:: Because an instance of the dependent variable, that is, the index
    zero in the above example, is set to be serialized with an external
    subtype, the corresponding file should be saved with a .csdfe extension.

.. testcleanup::

    import os

    os.remove("my_file.csdf")
    os.remove("my_file.csdfe")
    os.remove("my_file_0.dat")
